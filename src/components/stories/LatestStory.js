We have seen great results within other companies that are perhaps a little further ahead in their journey. Automation of tasks and processes frees up time that can then be used in more truly value-added work and help to reduce lead times. I am a strong believer in Seamless Flow and see it as a fundamental for Sandvik. ",

Strategists say the group has the potential to outperform from here due to expectations for interest-rate hikes being pushed back and the focus turning to stocks that can prove shockproof. The tech heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, home to the likes of Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp./ opened 1.5% higher on Monday, outshining the S&P 500, after Friday's brutal selloff.",
